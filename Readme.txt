The file of 'McLR Code' provides the core code of the paper 'SMU-Net: Saliency-guided Morphology-aware U-Net for Breast Lesion Segmentation in Ultrasound Image' which has been published in IEEE TMI, doi: 10.1109/TMI.2021.3116087.

This is a keras implementation of SMU-Net (Tensorflow backend).
The test environment is:
Python 3.6.5
Keras 2.2.4
tensorflow 1.13.0

In the futher, we will provide a version of Pytorch.
